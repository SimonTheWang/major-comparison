**Hey Shuya,**

  

First of all, congrats on your win!

Thanks for your questions today, wanted to answer you after giving it more thought.

Choosing a University major is a deeply personal matter, and itâ€™s a decision people often make without enough deep thought.

  
Let me start by giving you a logical breakdown:

| Major | Pros | Cons |
|--|--|--|
| Software Eng | - Connection to other Engineering Majors <br> - Exposure to multiple industries <br> - Allows you to become more of a "T"-shaped person* <br> -Engineers are better distinguished | - Might just go the consulting route <br> - Might become a "Jack of all trades, master of none" <br> |
|Comp Sci| - Better research opportunities <br> - More free time to work on passion-projects & startups <br> - Really Cool CS people <br> - Allows you to become an expert in CS | - Harder to develop interpersonal skills <br> - Might become "I"-shaped.

* T-Shaped person, read more on this, though![T shaped person](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6536081cd209e60364286a55/653612f75bd4e630b56fd6ac_624aa4164c04f5a361442550__m-shape-02.png)

With all this being said, the importance isn't the major you chose, it's being aware of the pros and cons of both, and try your best to counter-weigh them. I suggest you play to your strengths, all while allowing yourself to work on what you might need to develop. I understand your current environment will also influence your decision (parents, friends,...), but I am sure if you think about it beyond face-value, you will make the right decision. Either ways, even if you make the wrong decision, it will teach you a valuable lesson.

Peace.
